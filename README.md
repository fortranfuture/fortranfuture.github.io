## Overview

If you use electricity, fly in aircraft, take medication, eat food grown under the weather, or are defended by (the threat of) modern weapons, you depend on Fortran.  Fortran is essential to the sciences - e.g., Earth sciences, materials science, physics, chemistry - which underpins these, and many other, activities. This raises a **significant risk**: if we don't sustain the Fortran code that encodes such science, we can’t sustain or further advance that science. The consequence is that these sciences will decline, both in terms of advancing knowledge and in terms of their ability to continue to contribute positively to society, the economy and the environment. The UK, as one example, risks losing its world-leading position in a range of fundamental and applied sciences.

> How do we sustain sciences currently dependent on Fortran so that they continue to advance knowledge – and contribute to society, the economy and the environment – for the next 70 years?


## Background

Fortran codebases have a long and distinguished history of contributing to world-class science and engineering. It is both the oldest third-generation programming language in active use and development today, and the only standardised language with a native parallel programming model ([Curcic, 2020](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-fortran/9781617295287/)). Fortran codebases remain crucial for many current scientific disciplines (see Tables 1 and 2 for examples of research areas that have benefitted from Fortran codebases), and are mission-critical for some of the most significant national and international institutions and initiatives. Fortran has, therefore, over the last 70 years, made an immense and sustained contribution to science. And, in turn, that science has made, and continues to make, an enormous contribution to society, the economy and the environment. As one illustrative example: when the UK's Met Office warns of severe weather disruptions to travel and logistics it does so on the basis of 2M lines of Fortran code. Overall, since its inception in the mid-1950s, Fortran has had an remarkable (albeit indirect and hidden) impact on society, the economy and the environment. 

Received wisdom says that Fortran is an old and therefore obsolete language [1]. But there continues to be a very wide range of sciences that actively depend on Fortran codebases. This includes 6 of the top 10 codebases running on the UK's Archer2 HPC service [33 - 38]. (Also, Beliavsky actively maintains a list of several hundred Fortran codebases [39] and tools [40] on GitHub.)

Many scientific Fortran codebases are very large and are used by many others. As examples: the DFTB+ software package is ~300KLOFC and used by 100 - 200 groups; MESSY is ~4MLOFC; GAMESS-US has a user-base of >150,000 users; and MCTDH has a user-base of several hundred research groups.

New technologies are being developed in Fortran. For example, Rouson and his CLaSS group at Lawrence Berkley National Lab (LBNL) are developing a deep learning library ([Fiats](https://github.com/berkeleylab/fiats)) written entirely in Fortran, as well as a parallel runtime library ([Caffeine](https://github.com/berkeleylab/caffeine), part Fortran).


## Promising developments

there are already promising developments and opportunities around the periphery of Fortran-based science. There is increasing national and international recognition of the importance of professional research software engineers, e.g., with the UK's Society of Research Software Engineers and the United States' equivalent. Thus there is a growing appreciation of the importance of software engineering for science, and investment in the requisite skills base. But these initiatives do not have a specific focus on Fortran or Fortran-based science. By contrast, the focus tends to be toward 'modern' languages that are increasingly adopted in science, e.g., Python.

Furthermore, as of April 2024 (see also January 2025), Fortran has returned to the top 10 most popular programming languages, according to the respected [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). This return is attributed to the growing importance of numerical and mathematical computing, e.g., required for machine learning applications. This is encouraging for future recruitment of RSEs, however these indicators are not focused on science or on Fortran-based science, and may more accurately reflect the state of the computing industry, as well as industrial research. Furthermore, whilst the increase in popularity of Fortran is encouraging, there is also the need for application domain knowledge in the respective scientific discipline.

Fortran _as a language_ is in a stronger position today than at any time previously in its 70yr history. But again, these developments do not related specifically to Fortran-based science. The Fortran community has established [Fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) as the 'home' of the international community, and has made substantial progress on the Fortran language's technical ecosystem, with the implementation of a [standard library](https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/), a [package manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) (with an [fpm registry](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/nl/registry/index.html) under development), and an open source compiler, [LFortran](https://lfortran.org/) (also under development), that can be used interactively with Jupyter. The Fortran standards are now scheduled for regular five-year updates, first in [2018](https://wg5-fortran.org/f2018.html), then [2023](https://wg5-fortran.org/f2023.html), with the next update scheduled for 2028. As of April 2024, Fortran-lang is now an officially fiscally-sponsored project of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), whose mission is to promote open practices in research, data, and scientific computing. The membership of "J3", the USA's national body for the Fortran International Standards Committee, includes wide representation from many corporate hardware vendors (e.g., NVidia, Arm, Intel, HP, IBM, Fujistu) indicating the importance of Fortran to these vendors, in part because of the importance of Fortran to national science and national security. In the UK, the BCS (British Computer Society) Fortran Specialist Group has approx. [200 companies and institutions listed as members](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/interactive-software-services-ltd-closure/8608/7).

Given these independent and complementary initatives - relating to the Fortran _language_, its uptake in industry, and the increasing appreciation of the importance of research software engineering in general - now is the time to exploit these initiatives and undertake a programme of research dedicated to sustaining the future of Fortran-based science.
